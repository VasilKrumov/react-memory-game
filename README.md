# Memory Game built with Create React App Template

Memory Game, also known as the Concentration card game or Matching Game, is a simple card game where you need to match pairs by turn over 2 cards at a time. There are so many versions of it it is hard to in down it's exact origin. There are claims that the famuos writer of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain invented his own version. I googled it and whatever it is, it looks more like a way of trying to figure out how much tax you owe rather than match cards.

## To run the app run `npm install` && `npm start`
